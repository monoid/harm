This is a Rust library for syntheses of ARM64 instructions. It was derived from
the Arm Limited's [AARCHMRS
dataset](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/A-Profile%20Architecture#Downloads).
The crate's module structure follows the dataset tree structure. For each
instruction variant description, a function that synthesizes the variant is
generated.

The crate source code is generated by tools at the repository at
https://github.com/monoid/harm\.

Like the original data, the code is licensed under BSD-3-Clause license.

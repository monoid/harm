# AARCHMRS dataset as Rust code

This Rust library provides functionality for synthesizing ARM64 instruction
encodings. It was derived from the Arm Limited's [AARCHMRS
dataset](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/A-Profile%20Architecture#Downloads).

The crate's module structure follows the dataset tree structure. For each
instruction variant described in the dataset, a corresponding Rust function is
generated.

The source code of this crate is generated by tools at the same repository at
https://github.com/monoid/harm.

As with the original dataset, this code is licensed under BSD-3-Clause license.

## Regenerating dataset

To regenerate the code, use the `aarchmrs-generate` binary. The dataset URL and
MD5 checksum are pinned in the `aarchmrs-gen` crate.

Please, run `cargo fmt` afterwards.

# `harm` dynamic ARM assembler

This is a work in progress: a dynamic AArch64 assembler based on the low-level
code derived from the AARCHMRS dataset.

Using named functions instead of fiddling with raw bitmasks directly is expected
to be more error-proof.
